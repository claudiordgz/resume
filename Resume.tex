	\section*{Objective}
		As I started self learning C++ before my Masters in 2009, I used the Google Styleguide for C++ development. I found this, along with Code Complete and Effective C++, one of the best tools to creating standard code. By learning this, I could tackle more important things such as complex behaviors. I learned there is a lot to do in Artificial Intelligence, and the only way to tackle everything was to research, test, profile results, repeat, until the best solution is found. This process is intense and maybe not fit for everyone, but there is something so alluring about being in the dark and feeling that sensation when you get closer to a solution. I wish to apply my passions for thriving while being close to the technology I feel a huge amount of respect. Working in Google would allow me to not only keep developing and crafting quality solutions, but to be around people who are in the same standards, to me, that is something truly hard to find.
