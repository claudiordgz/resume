I decided to be a Software Developer when optimizing matrix calculations in my TI-89 calculator to make my life easier. My passion for development is in how I am able to improve the quality of life of a person just by making the software faster, lighter, and more robust all at the same time. I program using TDD because it provides me with a continuous flow of production while at the same time adding test coverage. Even though, I have built some UI in WPF, my love resides in the back end of things and making it more powerful, faster, better. 

My current interests are mostly related to optimization using every available tool at my disposal. There are hidden savings to discover whether it is through Software Architectures, Algorithm optimizations or Data Structure profiling. Lately, I've been dedicated to studying everything related to the build process, from design to deployment.  

Most of my time I try to learn new things to make things faster or keep researching evolutionary computation. Or maybe just learning what and how to optimize everything at my home, or planning my future with my family.
