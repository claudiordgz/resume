As I started self learning C++ before my Masters in 2009, I used Amazon for researching the most popular books on the subjects. The review system from amazon provides an excellent way to find great knowledge. Amazon helped raise my own bar with their own quality standards, I was able to provide great customer support, and obtain great knowledge, which eventually took me to learn better ways to craft my own code when developing AI. 
		
As a developer that loves quality, simplicity and AI, I want to be able to give back to Amazon and be part of what makes the company so great. Given that most of my experience is with Machine Learning and Optimization I want to keep creating better solutions for optimizing complex searching, but doing it for Amazon as a Software Developer.
