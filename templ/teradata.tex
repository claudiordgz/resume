Results are not everything. There are also many factors to take into account, like being able to change over time, performing multiple similar tasks, unit testing, automatic build and deploy packages, and the one factor most places do not consider, making small independent projects to allow further expansion of workforce, all this without changing the time constraints.

Software Development is my craft, and I am proud to be part of it to help my customers convert their desires to reality, including the most important thing of all, their brand. A software solution is just a solution, but when pairing it with a brand, it creates an experience. 

I've developed tests using Boost Unit Testing Framework and also CPPUnit, I also developed continuous integration using CruiseControl/Batch/Makefiles for C++, this makes me feel positive I can make the change Teradata wants in the right direction, the reusable and scalable direction.
